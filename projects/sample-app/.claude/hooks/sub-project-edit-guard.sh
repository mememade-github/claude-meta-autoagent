# Role Relativity — Edit/Write guard for §6-bearing sub-projects.
#
# ROOT Agent acts as Human for sub-projects that carry their own Meta-Evolution.
# Human role cannot modify sub-project files directly — only deliver STATE +
# GOAL via scripts/meta/delegate-goal.sh. This hook blocks Edit/Write tool
# calls targeting any file under a registered sub-project root.
#
# Self-disabling: if the current project has no §6 in CLAUDE.md, this is not
# a Meta-Evolution ROOT layer, so the hook exits 0 (no blocking). This lets
# the hook be portable via .claude/ sync without accidental effect downstream.
#
# Extend SUB_PROJECTS below when a new §6-bearing sub-project is added.
